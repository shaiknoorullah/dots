# notification (no --wait/--action): the caelestia (quickshell) notifier was probed 2026-07-18
# and hangs on `notify-send --wait --action=...` for the full timeout without ever returning
# an action (exit=124 after 6s) — a blocking --wait here would wedge this transient systemd
# nudge unit forever. The reliable one-key answer is the picker keybind (Super+Shift+;), which
# does not depend on notification-action support; this notification is only a reminder.
# Streak-positive wording, never guilt.
