# Found live: the capture job re-derives TODAY every hour by dropping AW's session and
# writing it again. It deleted deductions by session_id, so a gap the user classified as
# dinner was back to "unconfirmed misc" an hour later -- and a gap declared a MEETING,
# which is worked time, was deducted again. On a day with an offline meeting that is the
# meeting silently subtracted from the figure handed to an employer.
