"""Walk the days that need a human, pre-filled with whatever evidence exists.

The plan calls for "one blocking panel per day". This is deliberately a TERMINAL prompt
instead: a blocking Hyprland panel is inescapable by design, and the dead-man's switch that
makes one safe is Phase 2 work. A command the user chooses to run needs no such guard, and
shipping the capability now is worth more than shipping the modal.

Two kinds of question, which are not the same:

  gaps  an absence was recorded but nobody knows what it WAS. An offline meeting is
        worked time; lunch is not. Until answered the minutes are deducted, so the
        figure understates -- answering can only ever move it up or leave it.
  days  a working day with no session at all. Was it worked and unlogged, leave, or
        genuinely absent? These change the TARGET as well as the total.

Everything written here is confidence 1.0 and provenance `manual`: it is the user's own
testimony, which is exactly what the sheet is.

# A gap that was a meeting is WORKED time, so answering `meeting` must deduct nothing.
# That distinction is the whole reason gaps are asked about.
#
# It used to DELETE the deduction, which left no record that the question had ever been
# answered. The hourly AW refresh then re-derived the same gap from the same presence data
# and wrote it back as an unconfirmed deduction -- so a meeting the user had explicitly
# declared was deducted again an hour later, and asked about again. Now the row is KEPT
# at zero minutes with provenance manual:meeting: it deducts nothing, it is the durable
# record of the answer, and the refresh recognises it and leaves the interval alone.
# (deduction.category still has no `meeting` member, by design -- a meeting is not a kind
# of deduction. The provenance says what it was; the zero says what it costs.)
