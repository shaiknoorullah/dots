"""Invariant checks over the whole timetrack installation.

This module exists because the predecessor's defining failure was SILENT SUCCESS: it
asked ActivityWatch for a bucket name that did not exist, took the 404 as an empty list,
and reported zero hours for months without ever erroring. Nothing about its output
distinguished "you did not work" from "I am broken".

So every check here is written to fail LOUDLY and to say what to do about it. A check that
cannot decide returns `warn`, never `ok` -- an unknown must never read as healthy.

Severity decides the exit code: any `fail` exits 1, warnings alone exit 0.
