"""Paths, and the policy this repo is not allowed to contain.

`dots` is a PUBLIC repo, so nothing machine-, person- or company-specific lives here:
payroll figures, holiday dates, git author identities and the backfill calibration all
come from hand-copied files under ~/.config/timetrack/ (mode 0600) that chezmoi does not
manage. Every accessor below has a safe default so the package still imports and runs on
a machine where those files were never copied.
