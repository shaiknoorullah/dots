"""Explicit DDL with PRAGMA user_version migrations.

The previous design let sqlite_utils infer the schema from whatever happened to be
upserted. On a file that decides someone's pay that is not acceptable: there was no
CREATE TABLE anywhere, so "no work today" and "the table was never created" were
indistinguishable, and `alter=True` meant a typo in a key name silently added a column.

The DDL is embedded here rather than shipped as schema/*.sql so the package stays a
single importable unit with no data files to install -- it is still explicit, versioned
and reviewable in one place.

#
#   1. v_day_span sums every run regardless of actor, and clockd keeps a run open while an
#      agent advances with the human away. The submitted headline would then carry
#      agent-only time, which D3 says is dashboard-only.
#   2. ActivityWatch already measures the same minutes, so the day would be counted twice,
#      and the hourly AW refresh would then drop its own session and skip the day because a
#      live one exists, losing everything AW measured before the switch.
#
# Until both are settled the headline stays AW plus what the user recorded by hand, exactly
# as before, and the live rows accumulate as evidence: v_live_interval shows them so they
# can be compared against AW day by day before anyone decides they are the better source.
# Promotion is one row, `UPDATE schema_meta SET v='1' WHERE k='live_counts'`, and that row
